Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we\\'ll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name\\'s Andrew Ng and I\\'ll be instructor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I\\'ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I\\'m actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning. Paul Baumstarck \\nworks in machine learning and computer vision. Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\nis another PhD student, works in computational biology and in sort of the basic \\nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is the head TA — he\\'s head TA two years \\nin a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\nDaniel Ramage is — I guess he\\'s not here  — Daniel applies l earning algorithms to \\nproblems in natural language processing.  \\nSo you\\'ll get to know the TAs and me much better throughout this quarter, but just from \\nthe sorts of things the TA\\'s do, I hope you can already tell that machine learning is a \\nhighly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find learning algorithms to problems \\nin computer vision and biology and robots and language. And machine learning is one of \\nthose things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\nSo just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\nhelicopter pilots to biologists to people in computer systems or databases to economists \\nand sort of also an unending stream of people from industry coming to Stanford \\ninterested in applying machine learning methods to their own problems.  \\nSo yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwarded to me an article \\nin \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills that employers can\\'t say no to. So it\\'s about \\nsort of the 12 most desirable skills in all of IT and all of information technology, and \\ntopping the list was actually machine learning. So I think this is a good time to be \\nlearning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \\nof science and industry.  \\nI\\'m actually curious about something. Learning algorithms is one of the things that \\ntouches many areas of science and industries, and I\\'m just kind of curious. How many \\npeople here are computer science majors, are in the computer science department? Okay. \\nAbout half of you. How many people are from EE? Oh, okay, maybe about a fifth. How'),\n",

So as you can \\ntell from a cross-section of this class, I think we're a very diverse audience in this room, \\nand that's one of the things that makes this class fun to teach and fun to be in, I think.\"),\n",

And every time I teach this class, I can actually \\nvery confidently say that after December, no matter what you're going to do after this \\nDecember when you've sort of completed this class, you'll find the things you learn in \\nthis class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\nup doing later in your life.  \\nSo I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\nlearning. I feel that machine learning grew out of early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been \\nviewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actually turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of something that I wrote and to figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter.  \\nBut in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fly a helicopter or have \\nsoftware recognize handwritten digits, one very successful approach is to use a learning \\nalgorithm and have a computer learn by itself how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\nAnd in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\nworks well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess significant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical records of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was, what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medical records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of medical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical records that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\nhalf a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen times a day or more, and often without \\nknowing it. So, for example, every time you send mail via the US Postal System, turns \\nout there's an algorithm that tries to automatically read the zip code you wrote on your \\nenvelope, and that's done by a learning algorithm. So every time you send US mail, you \\nare using a learning algorithm, perhaps without even being aware of it.\"),\n",

So \\nevery time you write a check, there's another learning algorithm that you're probably \\nusing without even being aware of it.  \\nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone company was doing this, and lots of \\ncompanies like eBay as well that do electronic transactions, there's a good chance that \\nthere's a learning algorithm in the background trying to figure out if, say, your credit \\ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \\nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \\nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever, these are other examples of learning \\nalgorithms that have learned what sorts of things you like to buy or what sorts of movies \\nyou like to watch and can therefore give customized recommendations to you.  \\nJust about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \\nto explain to me some learning algorithm in the innards of my car that's sort of doing its \\nbest to optimize my driving performance for fuel efficiency or something.  \\nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \\nwithout even knowing it.  \\nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also doing things like giving us a growing \\nunderstanding of the human genome. So if someday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \\nlearning algorithms will have had a large role in that. That's sort of the thing that Tom \\nworks on, yes?  \\nSo in teaching this class, I sort of have three goals. One of them is just to I hope convey \\nsome of my own excitement about machine learning to you.  \\nThe second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be able to apply state-of-\\nthe-art machine learning algorithms to whatever problems you're interested in. And if you \\never need to build a system for reading zip codes, you'll know how to do that by the end \\nof this class.  \\nAnd lastly, by the end of this class, I realize that only a subset of you are interested in \\ndoing research in machine learning, but by the conclusion of this class, I hope that all of \\nyou will actually be well qualified to start doing research in machine learning, okay?  \\nSo let's say a few words about logistics. The prerequisites of this class are written on one \\nof the handouts, are as follows: In this class, I'm going to assume that all of you have sort \\nof basic knowledge of computer science and knowledge of the basic computer skills and \\nprinciples. So I assume all of you know what big?O notation, that all of you know about \\nsort of data structures like queues, stacks, binary trees, and that all of you know enough \\nprogramming skills to, like, write a simple computer program. And it turns out that most\"),\n",

I'll say a bit more about that later.  \\nI also assume familiarity with basic probability and statistics. So most undergraduate \\nstatistics class, like Stat 116 taught here at Stanford, will be more than enough. I'm gonna \\nassume all of you know what random variables are, that all of you know what expectation \\nis, what a variance or a random variable is. And in case of some of you, it's been a while \\nsince you've seen some of this material. At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \\ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as a refresher course under prerequisite class. \\nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \\nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basic linear algebra. And again, most undergraduate \\nlinear algebra courses are more than enough. So if you've taken courses like Math 51, \\n103, Math 113 or CS205 at Stanford, that would be more than enough. Basically, I'm \\ngonna assume that all of you know what matrixes and vectors are, that you know how to \\nmultiply matrices and vectors and multiply matrix and matrices, that you know what a \\nmatrix inverse is. If you know what an eigenvector of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \\nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not quite sure, that's fine, too. We'll go over it in \\nthe review sections.  \\nSo there are a couple more logistical things I should deal with in this class. One is that, as \\nmost of you know, CS229 is a televised class. And in fact, I guess many of you are \\nprobably watching this at home on TV, so I'm gonna say hi to our home viewers.  \\nSo earlier this year, I approached SCPD, which televises these classes, about trying to \\nmake a small number of Stanford classes publicly available or posting the videos on the \\nweb. And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \\npost videos of a small number of classes online, so on the Internet in a way that makes it \\npublicly accessible to everyone. I'm very excited about that because machine learning in \\nschool, let's get the word out there.  \\nOne of the consequences of this is that — let's see — so videos  or pictures of the students \\nin this classroom will not be posted online, so your images — so don't worry about being \\nby seeing your own face appear on YouTube one day. But the microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, so I guess the consequence of that is that because microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, no matter how irritated you are at me, don't yell out swear words in the \\nmiddle of class, but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces \\nat me, and that won't show, okay?  \\nLet's see. I also handed out this — ther e were two handouts I hope most of you have, \\ncourse information handout. So let me just say a few words about parts of these. On the \\nthird page, there's a section that says Online Resources.  \\nOh, okay. Louder? Actually, could you turn up the volume? Testing. Is this better? \\nTesting, testing. Okay, cool. Thanks.\"),\n",

The class has a home page, so it's in on the handouts. I \\nwon't write on the chalkboard — http:// cs229.stanford.edu. And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, and I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the technical content of this class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in the class to get to know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to have amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to talk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, please use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an account that's read by all the TAs and me. So \\nrather than sending us email individually, if you send email to this account, it will \\nactually let us get back to you maximally quickly with answers to your questions.  \\nIf you're asking questions about homework problems, please say in the subject line which \\nassignment and which question the email refers to, since that will also help us to route \\nyour question to the appropriate TA or to me appropriately and get the response back to \\nyou quickly.  \\nLet's see. Skipping ahead — let's see — for homework, one midterm, one open and term \\nproject. Notice on the honor code. So one thing that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this class more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you're sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also post on the class newsgroup if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this class are reasonably difficult. People that have \\ntaken the class before may tell you they were very difficult. And just I bet it would be \\nmore fun for you, and you'd probably have a better learning experience if you form a \\nstudy group of people to work with. So I definitely encourage you to do that.  \\nAnd just to say a word on the honor code, which is I definitely encourage you to form a \\nstudy group and work together, discuss homework problems together.

And obviously, \\nshowing your solutions to others or copying other solutions directly is right out.  \\nWe occasionally also reuse problem set questions from previous years so that the \\nproblems are a bit more debugged and work more smoothly. And as a result of that, I also \\nask you not to look at solutions from previous years, and this includes both sort of official \\nsolutions that we've given out to previous generations of this class and previous solutions \\nthat people that have taken this class in previous years may have written out by \\nthemselves, okay?  \\nSadly, in this class, there are usually — sadly, in previous y ears, there have often been a \\nfew honor code violations in this class. And last year, I think I prosecuted five honor code \\nviolations, which I think is a ridiculously large number. And so just don't work without \\nsolutions, and hopefully there'll be zero honor code violations this year. I'd love for that \\nto happen.  \\nThe section here on the late homework policy if you ever want to hand in a homework \\nlate, I'll leave you to read that yourself.  \\nWe also have a midterm, which is scheduled for Thursday, 8th of November at 6:00 p.m., \\nso please keep that evening free.  \\nAnd let's see. And one more administrative thing I wanted to say is about the class \\nproject. So part of the goal of this class is to leave you well equipped to apply machine \\nlearning algorithms to a problem or to do research in machine learning. And so as part of \\nthis class, I'll ask you to execute a small research project sort of as a small term project.  \\nAnd what most students do for this is either apply machine learning to a problem that you \\nfind interesting or investigate some aspect of machine learning. So to those of you that \\nare either already doing research or to those of you who are in industry, you're taking this \\nfrom a company, one fantastic sort of way to do a class project would be if you apply \\nmachine learning algorithms to a problem that you're interested in, to a problem that \\nyou're already working on, whether it be a science research problem or sort of a problem \\nin industry where you're trying to get a system to work using a learning algorithm.  \\nTo those of you that are not currently doing research, one great way to do a project would \\nbe if you apply learning algorithms to just pick a problem that you care about. Pick a \\nproblem that you find interesting, and apply learning algorithms to that and play with the \\nideas and see what happens.\"),\n",

And so I'm holding the list in my hand. You can go home later and \\ntake a look at it online.  \\nBut reading down this list, I see that last year, there were students that applied learning \\nalgorithms to control a snake robot. There was a few projects on improving learning \\nalgorithms. There's a project on flying autonomous aircraft. There was a project actually \\ndone by our TA Paul on improving computer vision algorithms using machine learning.  \\nThere are a couple of projects on Netflix rankings using learning algorithms; a few \\nmedical robots; ones on segmenting [inaudible] to segmenting pieces of the body using \\nlearning algorithms; one on musical instrument detection; another on irony sequence \\nalignment; and a few algorithms on understanding the brain neuroscience, actually quite a \\nfew projects on neuroscience; a couple of projects on undescending fMRI data on brain \\nscans, and so on; another project on market makings, the financial trading. There was an \\ninteresting project on trying to use learning algorithms to decide what is it that makes a \\nperson's face physically attractive. There's a learning algorithm on optical illusions, and \\nso on.  \\nAnd it goes on, so lots of fun projects. And take a look, then come up with your own \\nideas.

So projects can be done in groups of up to three people. \\nSo as part of forming study groups, later today as you get to know your classmates, I \\ndefinitely also encourage you to grab two other people and form a group of up to three \\npeople for your project, okay? And just start brainstorming ideas for now amongst \\nyourselves. You can also come and talk to me or the TAs if you want to brainstorm ideas \\nwith us.  \\nOkay.

He\\'s taught it for many years. \\nSo one day, he was in his office, and an old student of his from, like, ten years ago came \\ninto his office and he said, \"Oh, professor, professor, thank you so much for your \\nmachine learning class. I learned so much from it. There\\'s this stuff that I learned in your \\nclass, and I now use every day. And it\\'s helped me make lots of money, and here\\'s a \\npicture of my big house.\"  \\nSo my friend was very excited. He said, \"Wow. That\\'s great. I\\'m glad to hear this \\nmachine learning stuff was actually useful. So what was it that you learned? Was it \\nlogistic regression? Was it the PCA? Was it the data networks? What was it that you \\nlearned that was so helpful?\" And the student said, \"Oh, it was the MATLAB.\"  \\nSo for those of you that don\\'t know MATLAB yet, I hope you do learn it. It\\'s not hard, \\nand we\\'ll actually have a short MATLAB tutorial in one of the discussion sections for \\nthose of you that don\\'t know it.  \\nOkay.

So discussion \\nsections will be taught by the TAs, and attendance at discussion sections is optional, \\nalthough they\\'ll also be recorded and televised.

For the next two or three weeks, we\\'ll use the discussion sections \\nto go over the prerequisites to this class or if some of you haven\\'t seen probability or \\nstatistics for a while or maybe algebra, we\\'ll go over those in the discussion sections as a \\nrefresher for those of you that want one.  \\nLater in this quarter, we\\'ll also use the discussion sections to go over extensions for the \\nmaterial that I\\'m teaching in the main lectures.

Yeah?  \\nStudent : [Inaudible] R or something like that?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Oh, yeah, let's see, right. So our policy has been that you're \\nwelcome to use R, but I would strongly advise against it, mainly because in the last \\nproblem set, we actually supply some code that will run in Octave but that would be \\nsomewhat painful for you to translate into R yourself. So for your other assignments, if \\nyou wanna submit a solution in R, that's fine. But I think MATLAB is actually totally \\nworth learning. I know R and MATLAB, and I personally end up using MATLAB quite a \\nbit more often for various reasons. Yeah?  \\nStudent : For the [inaudible] project [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : So for the term project, you're welcome to do it in smaller \\ngroups of three, or you're welcome to do it by yourself or in groups of two. Grading is the \\nsame regardless of the group size, so with a larger group, you probably — I recommend \\ntrying to form a team, but it's actually totally fine to do it in a smaller group if you want.  \\nStudent : [Inaudible] what language [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng): So let's see. There is no C programming in this class other \\nthan any that you may choose to do yourself in your project. So all the homeworks can be \\ndone in MATLAB or Octave, and let's see. And I guess the program prerequisites is more \\nthe ability to understand big?O notation and knowledge of what a data structure, like a \\nlinked list or a queue or binary treatments, more so than your knowledge of C or Java \\nspecifically. Yeah?  \\nStudent : Looking at the end semester project, I mean, what exactly will you be testing \\nover there? [Inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Of the project?  \\nStudent : Yeah.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Yeah, let me answer that later. In a couple of weeks, I shall \\ngive out a handout with guidelines for the project. But for now, we should think of the \\ngoal as being to do a cool piece of machine learning work that will let you experience the\"),\n",

That\\'s probably \\nthe most common project. Some students will try to improve state-of-the-art machine \\nlearning. Some of those projects are also very successful. It\\'s a little bit harder to do. And \\nthere\\'s also a smaller minority of students that will sometimes try to prove — develop the \\ntheory of machine learning further or try to prove theorems about machine learning. So \\nthey\\'re usually great projects of all of those types with applications and machine learning \\nbeing the most common. Anything else? Okay, cool.  \\nSo that was it for logistics. Let\\'s talk about learning algorithms. So can I have the laptop \\ndisplay, please, or the projector? Actually, could you lower the big screen? Cool. This is \\namazing customer service. Thank you. I see. Okay, cool. Okay. No, that\\'s fine. I see. \\nOkay. That\\'s cool. Thanks. Okay.  \\nBig screen isn\\'t working today, but I hope you can read things on the smaller screens out \\nthere. Actually, [inaudible] I think this room just got a new projector that — someone \\nsent you an excited email — was it just on Frid ay? — saying we just got a new projector \\nand they said 4,000-to-1 something or other brightness ratio. I don\\'t know. Someone was \\nvery excited about the new projector in this room, but I guess we\\'ll see that in operation \\non Wednesday.  \\nSo start by talking about what machine learning is. What is machine learning? Actually, \\ncan you read the text out there? Raise your hand if the text on the small screens is legible. \\nOh, okay, cool, mostly legible. Okay. So I\\'ll just read it out.  \\nSo what is machine learning? Way back in about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine \\nlearning informally as the [inaudible] that gives computers to learn — [inaudible] that \\ngives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. So Arthur \\nSamuel, so way back in the history of machine learning, actually did something very \\ncool, which was he wrote a checkers program, which would play games of checkers \\nagainst itself.  \\nAnd so because a computer can play thousands of games against itself relatively quickly, \\nArthur Samuel had his program play thousands of games against itself, and over time it \\nwould start to learn to recognize patterns which led to wins and patterns which led to \\nlosses. So over time it learned things like that, \"Gee, if I get a lot of pieces taken by the \\nopponent, then I\\'m more likely to lose than win,\" or, \"Gee, if I get my pieces into a \\ncertain position, then I\\'m especially likely to win rather than lose.\"  \\nAnd so over time, Arthur Samuel had a checkers program that would actually learn to \\nplay checkers by learning what are the sort of board positions that tend to be associated \\nwith wins and what are the board positions that tend to be associated with losses. And \\nway back around 1959, the amazing thing about this was that his program actually \\nlearned to play checkers much better than Arthur Samuel himself could.'),\n",

And Arthur Samuel's checkers program was maybe \\nthe first I think really convincing refutation of this claim. Namely, Arthur Samuel \\nmanaged to write a checkers program that could play checkers much better than he \\npersonally could, and this is an instance of maybe computers learning to do things that \\nthey were not programmed explicitly to do.  \\nHere's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\nTom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows: He \\nsays that a computer program is set to learn from an experience E with respect to some \\ntask T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P \\nimproves with experience E. Okay. So not only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\nSo, for example, in the case of checkers, the experience E that a program has would be \\nthe experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\ntask of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be something like the \\nfraction of games it wins against a certain set of human opponents. And by this \\ndefinition, we'll say that Arthur Samuel's checkers program has learned to play checkers, \\nokay?  \\nSo as an overview of what we're going to do in this class, this class is sort of organized \\ninto four major sections. We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\nof which is supervised learning. So let me give you an example of that.  \\nSo suppose you collect a data set of housing prices. And one of the TAs, Dan Ramage, \\nactually collected a data set for me last week to use in the example later. But suppose that \\nyou go to collect statistics about how much houses cost in a certain geographic area. And \\nDan, the TA, collected data from housing prices in Portland, Oregon. So what you can do \\nis let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of the house, right, so \\nyou collect data on a bunch of houses. And let's say you get a data set like this with \\nhouses of different sizes that are listed for different amounts of money.  \\nNow, let's say that I'm trying to sell a house in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \\nwhere the data comes from. Let's say I have a house that's this size in square footage, and \\nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So \\nthere are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \\nabout to say before.  \\nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight line to it. And then \\nif this is my house, you may then look at the straight line and predict that my house is \\ngonna go for about that much money, right? There are other decisions that we can make, \\nwhich we'll talk about later, which is, well, what if I don't wanna put a straight line? \\nMaybe I should put a quadratic function to it. Maybe that fits the data a little bit better. \\nYou notice if you do that, the price of my house goes up a bit, so that'd be nice.\"),\n",

And the reason that it\\'s called supervised \\nlearning is because we\\'re providing the algorithm a data set of a bunch of square \\nfootages, a bunch of housing sizes, and as well as sort of the right answer of what the \\nactual prices of a number of houses were, right?  \\nSo we call this supervised learning because we\\'re supervising the algorithm or, in other \\nwords, we\\'re giving the algorithm the, quote, right answer for a number of houses. And \\nthen we want the algorithm to learn the association between the inputs and the outputs \\nand to sort of give us more of the right answers, okay?  \\nIt turns out this specific example that I drew here is an example of something called a \\nregression problem. And the term regression sort of refers to the fact that the variable \\nyou\\'re trying to predict is a continuous value and price.  \\nThere\\'s another class of supervised learning problems which we\\'ll talk about, which are \\nclassification problems. And so, in a classification problem, the variable you\\'re trying to \\npredict is discreet rather than continuous. So as one specific example — so actually a \\nstandard data set you can download online [inaudible] that lots of machine learning \\npeople have played with. Let\\'s say you collect a data set on breast cancer tumors, and you \\nwant to learn the algorithm to predict whether or not a certain tumor is malignant. \\nMalignant is the opposite of benign, right, so malignancy is a sort of harmful, bad tumor. \\nSo we collect some number of features, some number of properties of these tumors, and \\nfor the sake of sort of having a simple [inaudible] explanation, let\\'s just say that we\\'re \\ngoing to look at the size of the tumor and depending on the size of the tumor, we\\'ll try to \\nfigure out whether or not the tumor is malignant or benign.  \\nSo the tumor is either malignant or benign, and so the variable in the Y axis is either zero \\nor 1, and so your data set may look something like that, right? And that\\'s 1 and that\\'s \\nzero, okay? And so this is an example of a classification problem where the variable \\nyou\\'re trying to predict is a discreet value. It\\'s either zero or 1.  \\nAnd in fact, more generally, there will be many learning problems where we\\'ll have more \\nthan one input variable, more than one input feature and use more than one variable to try \\nto predict, say, whether a tumor is malignant or benign. So, for example, continuing with \\nthis, you may instead have a data set that looks like this. I\\'m gonna part this data set in a \\nslightly different way now. And I\\'m making this data set look much cleaner than it really \\nis in reality for illustration, okay?  \\nFor example, maybe the crosses indicate malignant tumors and the \"O\"s may indicate \\nbenign tumors. And so you may have a data set comprising patients of different ages and \\nwho have different tumor sizes and where a cross indicates a malignant tumor, and an \\n\"O\" indicates a benign tumor. And you may want an algorithm to learn to predict, given a \\nnew patient, whether their tumor is malignant or benign.'),\n",

So this is just another example of \\nanother supervised learning problem and another classification problem.  \\nAnd so it turns out that one of the issues we'll talk about later in this class is in this \\nspecific example, we're going to try to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign \\nbased on two features or based on two inputs, namely the age of the patient and the tumor \\nsize. It turns out that when you look at a real data set, you find that learning algorithms \\noften use other sets of features. In the breast cancer data example, you also use properties \\nof the tumors, like clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, \\n[inaudible] adhesion and so on, so various other medical properties.  \\nAnd one of the most interesting things we'll talk about later this quarter is what if your \\ndata doesn't lie in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional or sort of even a finite \\ndimensional space, but is it possible — what if your data actually lies in an infinite \\ndimensional space? Our plots here are two-dimensional space. I can't plot you an infinite \\ndimensional space, right? And so it turns out that one of the most successful classes of \\nmachine learning algorithms — some may call support vector machines — actually takes \\ndata and maps data to an infinite dimensional space and then does classification using not \\ntwo features like I've done here, but an infinite number of features.  \\nAnd that will actually be one of the most fascinating things we talk about when we go \\ndeeply into classification algorithms. And it's actually an interesting question, right, so \\nthink about how do you even represent an infinite dimensional vector in computer \\nmemory? You don't have an infinite amount of computers. How do you even represent a \\npoint that lies in an infinite dimensional space? We'll talk about that when we get to \\nsupport vector machines, okay?  \\nSo let's see. So that was supervised learning. The second of the four major topics of this \\nclass will be learning theory. So I have a friend who teaches math at a different \\nuniversity, not at Stanford, and when you talk to him about his work and what he's really \\nout to do, this friend of mine will — he's a ma th professor, right? — this friend of mine \\nwill sort of get the look of wonder in his eyes, and he'll tell you about how in his \\nmathematical work, he feels like he's discovering truth and beauty in the universe. And \\nhe says it in sort of a really touching, sincere way, and then he has this — you can see it \\nin his eyes — he has this deep appreciation of the truth and beauty in the universe as \\nrevealed to him by the math he does.  \\nIn this class, I'm not gonna do any truth and beauty. In this class, I'm gonna talk about \\nlearning theory to try to convey to you an understanding of how and why learning \\nalgorithms work so that we can apply these learning algorithms as effectively as possible.  \\nSo, for example, it turns out you can prove surprisingly deep theorems on when you can \\nguarantee that a learning algorithm will work, all right?

When can you prove a theorem guaranteeing that a \\nlearning algorithm will be at least 99.9 percent accurate on reading zip codes? This is \\nactually somewhat surprising. We actually prove theorems showing when you can expect \\nthat to hold.  \\nWe'll also sort of delve into learning theory to try to understand what algorithms can \\napproximate different functions well and also try to understand things like how much \\ntraining data do you need? So how many examples of houses do I need in order for your \\nlearning algorithm to recognize the pattern between the square footage of a house and its \\nhousing price? And this will help us answer questions like if you're trying to design a \\nlearning algorithm, should you be spending more time collecting more data or is it a case \\nthat you already have enough data; it would be a waste of time to try to collect more. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that as I walk around sort of \\nindustry in Silicon Valley or as I work with various businesses in CS and outside CS, I \\nfind that there's often a huge difference between how well someone who really \\nunderstands this stuff can apply a learning algorithm versus someone who sort of gets it \\nbut sort of doesn't.  \\nThe analogy I like to think of is imagine you were going to a carpentry school instead of \\na machine learning class, right? If you go to a carpentry school, they can give you the \\ntools of carpentry. They'll give you a hammer, a bunch of nails, a screwdriver or \\nwhatever. But a master carpenter will be able to use those tools far better than most of us \\nin this room. I know a carpenter can do things with a hammer and nail that I couldn't \\npossibly. And it's actually a little bit like that in machine learning, too. One thing that's \\nsadly not taught in many courses on machine learning is how to take the tools of machine \\nlearning and really, really apply them well.  \\nSo in the same way, so the tools of machine learning are I wanna say quite a bit more \\nadvanced than the tools of carpentry. Maybe a carpenter will disagree. But a large part of \\nthis class will be just giving you the raw tools of machine learning, just the algorithms \\nand so on. But what I plan to do throughout this entire quarter, not just in the segment of \\nlearning theory, but actually as a theme running through everything I do this quarter, will \\nbe to try to convey to you the skills to really take the learning algorithm ideas and really \\nto get them to work on a problem.  \\nIt's sort of hard for me to stand here and say how big a deal that is, but when I walk \\naround companies in Silicon Valley, it's completely not uncommon for me to see \\nsomeone using some machine learning algorithm and then explain to me what they've \\nbeen doing for the last six months, and I go, oh, gee, it should have been obvious from \\nthe start that the last six months, you've been wasting your time, right?  \\nAnd so my goal in this class, running through the entire quarter, not just on learning \\ntheory, is actually not only to give you the tools of machine learning, but to teach you \\nhow to use them well.

And this is something I\\'m really convinced is a huge deal, and so by the \\nend of this class, I hope all of you will be master carpenters. I hope all of you will be \\nreally good at applying these learning algorithms and getting them to work amazingly \\nwell in many problems. Okay?  \\nLet\\'s see. So [inaudible] the board. After learning theory, there\\'s another class of learning \\nalgorithms that I then want to teach you about, and that\\'s unsupervised learning. So you \\nrecall, right, a little earlier I drew an example like this, right, where you have a couple of \\nfeatures, a couple of input variables and sort of malignant tumors and benign tumors or \\nwhatever. And that was an example of a supervised learning problem because the data \\nyou have gives you the right answer for each of your patients. The data tells you this \\npatient has a malignant tumor; this patient has a benign tumor. So it had the right \\nanswers, and you wanted the algorithm to just produce more of the same.  \\nIn contrast, in an unsupervised learning problem, this is the sort of data you get, okay? \\nWhere speaking loosely, you\\'re given a data set, and I\\'m not gonna tell you what the right \\nanswer is on any of your data. I\\'m just gonna give you a data set and I\\'m gonna say, \\n\"Would you please find interesting structure in this data set?\" So that\\'s the unsupervised \\nlearning problem where you\\'re sort of not given the right answer for everything.  \\nSo, for example, an algorithm may find structure in the data in the form of the data being \\npartitioned into two clusters, or clustering is sort of one example of an unsupervised \\nlearning problem.  \\nSo I hope you can see this. It turns out that these sort of unsupervised learning algorithms \\nare also used in many problems. This is a screen shot — this is a picture I got from Sue \\nEmvee, who\\'s a PhD student here, who is applying unsupervised learning algorithms to \\ntry to understand gene data, so is trying to look at genes as individuals and group them \\ninto clusters based on properties of what genes they respond to — based on properties of \\nhow the genes respond to different experiments.  \\nAnother interesting application of [inaudible] sorts of clustering algorithms is actually \\nimage processing, this which I got from Steve Gules, who\\'s another PhD student. It turns \\nout what you can do is if you give this sort of data, say an image, to certain unsupervised \\nlearning algorithms, they will then learn to group pixels together and say, gee, this sort of \\npixel seems to belong together, and that sort of pixel seems to belong together.  \\nAnd so the images you see on the bottom — I guess you can just barely see them on there \\n— so the images you see on the bottom are groupings — are what the algorithm has done \\nto group certain pixels together. On a small display, it might be easier to just look at the \\nimage on the right. The two images on the bottom are two sort of identical visualizations \\nof the same grouping of the pixels into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd so it turns out that this sort of clustering algorithm or this sort of unsupervised \\nlearning algorithm, which learns to group pixels together, it turns out to be useful for \\nmany applications in vision, in computer vision image processing.'),\n",

This is actually a \\npicture taken of the Stanford campus. You can apply that sort of clustering algorithm and \\ngroup the picture into regions. Let me actually blow that up so that you can see it more \\nclearly. Okay. So in the middle, you see the lines sort of grouping the image together, \\ngrouping the image into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd what Ashutosh and Min did was they then applied the learning algorithm to say can \\nwe take this clustering and use it to build a 3D model of the world? And so using the \\nclustering, they then had a learning algorithm try to learn what the 3D structure of the \\nworld looks like so that they could come up with a 3D model that you can sort of fly \\nthrough, okay? Although many people used to think it's not possible to take a single \\nimage and build a 3D model, but using a learning algorithm and that sort of clustering \\nalgorithm is the first step. They were able to.  \\nI'll just show you one more example. I like this because it's a picture of Stanford with our \\nbeautiful Stanford campus. So again, taking the same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \\nthe same sort of unsupervised learning algorithm, you can group the pixels into different \\nregions. And using that as a pre-processing step, they eventually built this sort of 3D \\nmodel of Stanford campus in a single picture. You can sort of walk into the ceiling, look \\naround the campus. Okay? This actually turned out to be a mix of supervised and \\nunsupervised learning, but the unsupervised learning, this sort of clustering was the first \\nstep.  \\nSo it turns out these sorts of unsupervised — clustering algorithms are actually routinely \\nused for many different problems, things like organizing computing clusters, social \\nnetwork analysis, market segmentation, so if you're a marketer and you want to divide \\nyour market into different segments or different groups of people to market to them \\nseparately; even for astronomical data analysis and understanding how galaxies are \\nformed. These are just a sort of small sample of the applications of unsupervised learning \\nalgorithms and clustering algorithms that we'll talk about later in this class.  \\nJust one particularly cool example of an unsupervised learning algorithm that I want to \\ntell you about. And to motivate that, I'm gonna tell you about what's called the cocktail \\nparty problem, which is imagine that you're at some cocktail party and there are lots of \\npeople standing all over. And you know how it is, right, if you're at a large party, \\neveryone's talking, it can be sometimes very hard to hear even the person in front of you. \\nSo imagine a large cocktail party with lots of people. So the problem is, is that all of these \\npeople talking, can you separate out the voice of just the person you're interested in \\ntalking to with all this loud background noise?  \\nSo I'll show you a specific example in a second, but here's a cocktail party that's I guess \\nrather sparsely attended by just two people. But what we're gonna do is we'll put two \\nmicrophones in the room, okay? And so because the microphones are just at slightly \\ndifferent distances to the two people, and the two people may speak in slightly different \\nvolumes, each microphone will pick up an overlapping combination of these two people's\"),\n",

We'll talk about \\nthat more when we go and describe ICA or independent component analysis algorithms, \\nwhich is what you just saw.\"),\n",

It sounds like a pretty complicated thing to do. So you\\'re gonna ask how complicated \\nis it really to implement an algorithm like this? It turns out if you do it in MATLAB, you \\ncan do it in one line of code.  \\nSo I got this from Samuel Wyse at Toronto, U of Toronto, and the example I showed you \\nactually used a more complicated ICA algorithm than this. But nonetheless, I guess this is \\nwhy for this class I\\'m going to ask you to do most of your programming in MATLAB and \\nOctave because if you try to implement the same algorithm in C or Java or something, I \\ncan tell you from personal, painful experience, you end up writing pages and pages of \\ncode rather than relatively few lines of code. I\\'ll also mention that it did take researchers \\nmany, many years to come up with that one line of code, so this is not easy.  \\nSo that was unsupervised learning, and then the last of the four major topics I wanna tell \\nyou about is reinforcement learning. And this refers to problems where you don\\'t do one-\\nshot decision-making. So, for example, in the supervised learning cancer prediction \\nproblem, you have a patient come in, you predict that the cancer is malignant or benign. \\nAnd then based on your prediction, maybe the patient lives or dies, and then that\\'s it, \\nright? So you make a decision and then there\\'s a consequence. You either got it right or \\nwrong. In reinforcement learning problems, you are usually asked to make a sequence of \\ndecisions over time.  \\nSo, for example, this is something that my students and I work on. If I give you the keys \\nto an autonomous helicopter — we actually ha ve this helicopter here at Stanford, — how \\ndo you write a program to make it fly, right? You notice that if you make a wrong \\ndecision on a helicopter, the consequence of crashing it may not happen until much later. \\nAnd in fact, usually you need to make a whole sequence of bad decisions to crash a \\nhelicopter. But conversely, you also need to make a whole sequence of good decisions in \\norder to fly a helicopter really well.  \\nSo I\\'m gonna show you some fun videos of learning algorithms flying helicopters. This is \\na video of our helicopter at Stanford flying using a controller that was learned using a \\nreinforcement learning algorithm. So this was done on the Stanford football field, and \\nwe\\'ll zoom out the camera in a second. You\\'ll sort of see the trees planted in the sky. So \\nmaybe this is one of the most difficult aerobatic maneuvers flown on any helicopter under \\ncomputer control. And this controller, which is very, very hard for a human to sit down \\nand write out, was learned using one of these reinforcement learning algorithms.  \\nJust a word about that: The basic idea behind a reinforcement learning algorithm is this \\nidea of what\\'s called a reward function. What we have to think about is imagine you\\'re \\ntrying to train a dog. So every time your dog does something good, you say, \"Good dog,\" \\nand you reward the dog. Every time your dog does something bad, you go, \"Bad dog,\" \\nright? And hopefully, over time, your dog will learn to do the right things to get more of \\nthe positive rewards, to get more of the \"Good dogs\" and to get fewer of the \"Bad dogs.”'),\n",

And \\nthen it\\'s up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \\nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \\nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applied to other problems in robotics. It\\'s applied \\nto things in web crawling and so on. But it\\'s just cool to show videos, so let me just show \\na bunch of them. This learning algorithm was actually implemented by our head TA, \\nZico, of programming a four-legged dog. I guess Sam Shriver in this class also worked \\non the project and Peter Renfrew and Mike and a few others. But I guess this really is a \\ngood dog/bad dog since it\\'s a robot dog.  \\nThe second video on the right, some of the students, I guess Peter, Zico, Tonca working \\non a robotic snake, again using learning algorithms to teach a snake robot to climb over \\nobstacles.  \\nBelow that, this is kind of a fun example. Ashutosh Saxena and Jeff Michaels used \\nlearning algorithms to teach a car how to drive at reasonably high speeds off roads \\navoiding obstacles.  \\nAnd on the lower right, that\\'s a robot programmed by PhD student Eva Roshen to teach a \\nsort of somewhat strangely configured robot how to get on top of an obstacle, how to get \\nover an obstacle. Sorry. I know the video\\'s kind of small. I hope you can sort of see it. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think all of these are robots that I think are very difficult to hand-code a controller \\nfor by learning these sorts of learning algorithms. You can in relatively short order get a \\nrobot to do often pretty amazing things.  \\nOkay. So that was most of what I wanted to say today. Just a couple more last things, but \\nlet me just check what questions you have right now. So if there are no questions, I\\'ll just \\nclose with two reminders, which are after class today or as you start to talk with other \\npeople in this class, I just encourage you again to start to form project partners, to try to \\nfind project partners to do your project with. And also, this is a good time to start forming \\nstudy groups, so either talk to your friends or post in the newsgroup, but we just \\nencourage you to try to start to do both of those today, okay? Form study groups, and try \\nto find two other project partners.  \\nSo thank you. I\\'m looking forward to teaching this class, and I\\'ll see you in a couple of \\ndays.'),\n",
